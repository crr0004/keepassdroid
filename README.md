KeePass implementation for android

I am maintaining a seperate fork from the [original](https://github.com/bpellin/keepassdroid) with some pull requests merged in.

I started this fork because I wanted to include a fingerprint unlock feature. 
I discovered the original repo has a working fingerprint branch that hasn't been merged into the master and released onto the playstore.
I have since merged this into my master branch and it is working as intended, as far as I can see. 
I do not know if the original author has abandoned the project or not, the last commit was back in April of 2017.
